            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p class="important-paragraph-text">Income from streaming music varies greatly from platform to platform, making it difficult for musicians to understand where they may make the most money from and how much energy they should put into promotion on certain platforms.</p>

                <h2>Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

            <h2>User Scenario</h2>
            <p class="important-paragraph-text">Bryndon is a drummer who makes his living from touring and playing on records. The Publishing Rights Organization(PRO) that represents Bryndon pays out his streaming royalties quarterly, though he has no way of anticipating how much to expect. Since Bryndon is on the road often he needs a way to anticipate his quarterly income from streaming royalties while on the go and would appreciate infographic that made it easy for him to quickly understand where his income was coming from.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Improvements</h2>
            <p class="important-paragraph-text">After evaluating the task flow a number of issues began to appear. There were too many tasks for the user per page. I solved this by breaking up the tasks to more pages. The dialog was too stiff, it needed to seem more human. By using clear verbs it because more user friendly. Lastly, by moving the sign up page to the end of the flow users could try out the product without having to commit to signing up before hand.</p>

            <h2>Design Retrospective</h2>
            <div class="design-retrospective">
                <p>Are the details right to support the scenarios? Are the users goals being achieved? Does the design work well in the user’s environment and context?</p> 
                <p>I believe the user's goals are being achieved with this design, but it is not the most mobile friendly execution. My thinking is that there would be an application for users to monitor streaming activity, but the uploading of data would be handled on the website.</p>

            </video>
       
            <p class="proto-text">When moving onto high fidelity comps I decided to focus on the mobile experience since it was more inline with the user scenario. The prototyped user flow depicts a new user entering data and viewing their synthesized data once it has finished processing. The user may then sign up for the service to save this information to their profile.

            <h3>To improve upon these designs I would:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Conduct usability testing</li>
                <li>Build out more pages and functions</li>
                <li>Build & test a mobile app</li>
