            <h1>DataTune: Take Control Of Your Streams</h1>
            <h2>The Data</h2>

            </a>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p class="important-paragraph-text">Income from streaming music varies greatly from platform to platform, making it difficult for musicians to understand where they may make the most money from and how much energy they should put into promotion on certain platforms.</p>

            <section class="case-study-list">
                <h2>Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trying to do too much</li>
                    <li>Not designing for the target user</li>
                    <li>Too much focus on technology and features</li>
                    <li>Falling for the first solution</li>
                    <li>Considering feasibility during brainstorming</li>
                    <li>Prototyping in too high of a fidelity</li>
                    <li>Not scheduling time for iteration and refinement</li>
                    <li>Releasing before fixing the small bugs</li>

                <p>Allows users to view their potential income on platforms they have yet to upload music to</p>
                <p>Brings awareness to financial disparities within the music industry</p>

                <h2>User Insights:</h2>
                <p><em>“I’m always surprised when the direct deposit comes in ‘cause I forget about it”</em></p>
                
                <p><em>“It’s really hard to know how much money will be coming in each quarter from streaming”

            <h2>User Scenario</h2>
            <p class="important-paragraph-text">Bryndon is a drummer who makes his living from touring and playing on records. The Publishing Rights Organization(PRO) that represents Bryndon pays out his streaming royalties quarterly, though he has no way of anticipating how much to expect. Since Bryndon is on the road often he needs a way to anticipate his quarterly income from streaming royalties while on the go and would appreciate infographic that made it easy for him to quickly understand where his income was coming from.</p>

            <h2>Evaluated Task Flow</h2>
            <div class="task-flow">
                <strong class="strong-even">1. DataTune homepage</strong>

                <strong class="strong-odd">2. Input your data into the system</strong>

            </div>

            <h2>Improvements</h2>
            <p class="important-paragraph-text">After evaluating the task flow a number of issues began to appear. There were too many tasks for the user per page. I solved this by breaking up the tasks to more pages. The dialog was too stiff, it needed to seem more human. By using clear verbs it because more user friendly. Lastly, by moving the sign up page to the end of the flow users could try out the product without having to commit to signing up before hand.</p>

            <h2>Design Retrospective</h2>
            <div class="design-retrospective">
                <p>Are the details right to support the scenarios? Are the users goals being achieved? Does the design work well in the user’s environment and context?</p> 
                <p>I believe the user's goals are being achieved with this design, but it is not the most mobile friendly execution. My thinking is that there would be an application for users to monitor streaming activity, but the uploading of data would be handled on the website.</p>

            <p class="proto-text">When moving onto high fidelity comps I decided to focus on the mobile experience since it was more inline with the user scenario. The prototyped user flow depicts a new user entering data and viewing their synthesized data once it has finished processing. The user may then sign up for the service to save this information to their profile.
