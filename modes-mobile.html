            <h1>Why is learning about user experience so...difficult?</h1>
            <p>My objective was to design a mobile application that would give users a place to stay up to date on UXUI news and design trends without feeling overwhelmed with the amount of information available to them from “googling” a topic.</p>

            <img class="dd-info" src="images/double-diamond-infograph.png" alt="Double Diamond Design Process Infographic">

            <p>I used the double diamond design process because it kept me focused on the root problem the user was facing. It puts the users needs before the wants of the designer or any assumptions they may have. 
            Since there was not yet a product available for the issue at hand I couldn’t perform a comparative analysis, but I did consider apps like Apple News and the way they mix informative articles with more light hearted ones.
            I chose to conduct my user interviews first so I could synthesize a User Persona from the insights I gained, and then design with that user in mind. I made sure to interview at least 5 potential users to broaden the scope of their responses. 
            </p>

            <h2>User Persona</h2>
            
            <a href="images/ux-student-persona.png" target="_blank">
                <img src="images/ux-student-persona.png" alt="User Experience Student Persona">
            </a>

            <p>From my user interviews I synthesized a persona. Meet Jenni, a thirty-something living in Austin, texas who likes to keep up to date with UXUI trends so she may do well in school and land a job once she graduates.</p>
            <p>Each design exercise brought its own advantage to the process. Crazy 8’s inspired creative problem solving while also speeding up the iteration process. Through this exercise I came up with the idea of creating an app with two modes. One would be a news feed of articles from sources the user followed, the other would be  “relaxation” mode,  a feed of videos, music, and puzzles that the user found entertaining or relaxing.</p>

            <h2>Ideation</h2>

            <h3>UI Flow</h3>

            <img src="images/Joseph Postiglione- UI Final - UI Flow.png" alt="UI Flow Drawing">

            <h3>Site Map</h3>

            <img src="images/Joseph Postiglione- UI Final - Site Map V2.png" alt="Site Map Drawing">

            <p>The Site Map helped form the information architecture of the app and made it simple to see any pages I may have overlooked, and the UI Flow helped keep me in the shoes of the user. UI Flows can usually help detect potentially confusing patterns within the app, but in this case I still overlooked one.</p>

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>

            <img src="images/Wireframes.png" alt="Wireframes">

            <p>Now that I had discovered and defined the problem my users were facing, it was time to create some wireframes. I chose to wireframe out a simple news feed that users could curate from a list of popular, vetted sources. When the user felt they needed a break from learning (or after a predetermined amount of time) they could access an alternative mode called “Relaxation Mode”. This alternate feed would also be user curated, but would instead focus on videos and topics the user found relaxing.</p>

            <h2>Usability Testing Results</h2>

            <div class="user-feedback-2">

                <h3>User 1:</h3>
                <p><em>I was not sure why the relaxation page was separate from the main feed.</em></p>
                
                <p><em>Not having visual content also made it hard to navigate into articles.</em></p>
                
                <p><em>She was not sold on the relaxation page idea in general.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="user-feedback-2">

                <h3>User 2:</h3>
                <p><em>Likes that it is familiar like instagram.</em></p>
                
                <p><em>Would be cool if relaxation mode was timed.</em></p>
                
                <p><em>An alert asking if one needs an eye break.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="user-feedback-2">

                <h3>User 3:</h3>
                <p><em>Everything made a lot of sense.</em></p>
    
                <p><em>Relaxation page needs some more signifiers.</em></p>
            </div>

            <p>After conducting a round of usability testing with my wireframes it was apparent that “Relaxation Mode” was confusing and hard to find. After researching the subject I found that mode slips and low discoverability were common issues when using modes on mobile. 
            Each user provided crucial insights that I had overlooked in my initial ideation phase. The most common being that there were issues with the discoverability and usability of relaxation mode. Since this was the core of the design I knew it needed a major overhaul.</p>

            <h2>High Fidelity Prototype</h2>

            <img class="proto-gif" src="images/content-proto.gif" alt="Prototype Animated GIF">

            <p class="proto-text">As a solution I redesigned the app in a way that incorporated the same functionality of “relaxation mode” into the general user flow. I did this by incorporating the functions of “relaxation mode” into the news feed. Users could now scroll through vetted, targeted articles with an occasional “healthy” distraction. This allows the user to take a break from learning without abandoning their search for knowledge completely by leaving the app.</p>

            <div class="insight">

                <p>The flaws within the apps interface and flow became obvious only after the initial usability testing. After making major revisions to the UI and conducting another round of testing the final product was received much better.</p>
            </div>

            <img class="usability-icon" src="images/usability-icon.png" alt="Usability Icon">

            <h2>Given More Time...</h2>

            <p>If this project was to continue I would make sure to conduct further usability testing with more complete prototypes. Some users suggested that it was difficult to grasp the functionality without all of the content being populated. I would also create a more complex Site Map to strengthen the Information Architecture as the app grew in scale. I think this sort of app could benefit from a large system of user customizable options, all of which would have to be tested significantly.</p>
